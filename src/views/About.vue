      Lab manuals are useful tools for documenting the standard functioning of a research laboratory to ensure
      that all lab members have a shared understanding of who they are and how they do things. The creation of a
      lab manual should be a joint effort between lab members to ensure that everyone agrees with its content
      and have their needs taken into consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help researchers create their own lab manual we developed a general lab manual template that lists
      a wide variety of different topics that could be included in a lab manual in a structured format. For some
      of the topics where we were expecting little variation in the procedures they cover we include boilerplate
      texts in the template. Thus, users do not have to reinvent the wheel but they can choose the boilerplate text
      that is the most suitable for their needs.

      Using our web application researchers can use the lab manual template as a starting point to create their own
      manual.
      The application takes care of the formatting so researhcers can focus on the content of their lab manual. We also
      wrote a guideline that contains more information on the different topics included in our template and a
      description
      of our suggested workflow for creating your own manual.
